         #:y-min -0.5 #:y-max 1.5)))

;plot-width and plot-height give the size of the window
;#:width refers to the thickness of the line
;#:samples is the number of sample points. decrease it if
;your program takes too much time
;#:x-min -1 #:x-max 2 says that the graph is plotted in
;the x-axis range -1 to 2

;; Defining the 'make-point' constructor and 'x-of' , 'y-of' selectors.

(define (make-point x y)
  (lambda (bit)
    (if (zero? bit) x y)))

(define (x-of point)
  (point 0))

(define (y-of point)
  (point 1))

;; Answer to Question-1

(define (vertical-line p l)
  (lambda (t) (make-point (x-of p) (+ (y-of p) (* l t)))))
